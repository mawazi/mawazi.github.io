Star Trek : Discovery

Is Discovery closer to the Ur Star Trek Universe?

Discovery is a fascinating addition to the Star Trek ecosphere. It is a visual re-imagining of Trek's "Prime" timeline, the same timeline that pretty much all of Star Trek has occurred in, except for the "Kelvin" timeline films initiated by J.J. Abrams. While the Kelvin films have re-written the basic, known events of the Prime timeline, by using the concept of a parallel universe, Discovery's producers have quite strenuously emphasized that it occurs within the Prime timeline, so must adhere to known events from all of the other shows and movies. They chose a starting point of approximately ten years prior to the beginning of the Original Series (TOS).
